# Domain Feature Perturbation for Domain Generalization

This repository is the official implementation of [Domain Feature Perturbation for Domain Generalization](). 

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

Python 3.8, Pytorch 1.8
To install requirements:

```anaconda env
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
please modify the prefix to your anaconda dir

## Dataset
make sure the directory structures are as follows:

```
PACS
â””â”€â”€ kfold
    â”œâ”€â”€ art_painting
    â”œâ”€â”€ cartoon
    â”œâ”€â”€ photo
    â””â”€â”€ sketch
```

```
office_home
â”œâ”€â”€ Art
â”œâ”€â”€ Clipart
â”œâ”€â”€ Product
â”œâ”€â”€ RealWorld
â”œâ”€â”€ ImageInfo.csv
â””â”€â”€ imagelist.txt
```

```
TerraIncognita
â”œâ”€â”€ location_38
â”œâ”€â”€ location_43
â”œâ”€â”€ location_46
â””â”€â”€ location_100
```

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```PACS
bash sweep/PACS/run.sh launch /root/data 4,5,6,7
```

```OfficeHome
bash sweep/OfficeHome/run.sh launch /root/data 4,5,6,7
```

```TerraIncognita
bash sweep/TerraIncognita/run.sh launch /root/data 0,1,2,3
```

>ðŸ“‹  You need to change "/root/data" to your own dir of corresponding dataset. "4,5,6,7" means the GPU ID you suppose to use.

## Collect Results

To collect the accuracy results, run:

```
python -m domainbed.scripts.collect_results\
       --input_dir=/root/output/PACS
```

>ðŸ“‹  Please change the input_dir to your results dir.
